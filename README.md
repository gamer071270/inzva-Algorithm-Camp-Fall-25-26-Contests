# inzva-Algorithm-Camp-Fall-25-26-Contests

This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems solved during the inzva 8-week Algorithm Camp.
Each script includes the original problem statement as comments, followed by my Java implementation.

The problems cover core topics such as data structures, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and
efficient problem-solving techniques, with a focus on time and space complexity.

These solutions were developed under competitive programming constraints, including midterm and final contests.
